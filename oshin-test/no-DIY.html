    <h4>Today’s the day!</h4>
        <p> After weeks of waiting, it’s finally here! Your do-it-yourself heart surgery kit has just come in the mail! You’ve got your home office decked out with towels and mirrors and you’re ready to get rid of that nagging pain in your chest!
    </p>

       <p>
        Obviously this never happens. Why? Well for one, most of us are not heart surgeons, and for those of us who are - we aren’t about to perform open heart surgery ourselves. If the website is the heart of our business - or at least the source of our credibility online link to : https://www.sweor.com/firstimpressions why do so many of us think we can operate on it on our own?
       </p> 
        <p>
            We’ve all had the thought - if I use this platform or that platform (not naming names) there are tons of beautiful custom templates I can use! And on top of it, there’s a plugin for SEO! And it’s CHEAP! No brainer right?
        </p>
  
        <p>   Wrong.</p>
     
        
        
        
        <p>Custom templates can sound great - but almost always they will end up looking homemade or unprofessional. It is estimated that PULLQUOTE THIS 75% of users base their impression of the credibility of your site on the design itself.PULLQUOTE This means you could have the world’s most amazing business, be an upstanding, trustworthy, service-oriented firm that everyone loves, but if you used a DIY website builder, chances are you’re going to lose credibility with folks that don’t know you.</p>
        
        <p>But wait there’s more!</p>
        
        <p>Everyone has a website these days - even your elderly neighbor lady’s book club probably has a website. We support that (and if you need a website for your book club let us know) but that also means that your competitors have websites too. As mentioned above, if users are making a judgment call on your site, purely on how good your design looks, then it seems like it’d be pretty darn important to invest in something that looks great - especially better than your competitors.</p> 
        
        <h4>Know What You’re Paying For</h4>
        <p>Ok cool, I’ll go find a pro to build my website. Unfortunately, it’s not that simple. Different web design firms use different methods. Some web design firms have really fancy custom templates that they’ve made and will throw your content into - this means that the end result can look similar to their other clients - it also means they’re spending less time coding your project. In other words, you’re paying a premium price for a cookie-cutter product. </p>
        
        <p>Did you know that some web design firms don’t even write their own code? They’ll use fancy website builders (that granted, do have a learning curve) but they are limited in what they’re able to build. </p>
        
        <p>Ok you say, you found someone who does all of their designs from scratch and hand codes everything. Awesome! Sounds like you’re on the right track. However, do they know how to write? I’m sure they can code and design just fine, but do they have formal training in writing marketing copy? Too often, web design firms will expect you to be the marketing guru and know how to write impactful, moving, energetic marketing content that will drive conversions. </p>
        
        <h4>The Oshin Way</h4>
        <p>At Oshin, we design everything from scratch, hand-code everything so it is perfectly suited to blow your competition away and build trust with your customers. Not only that, our content writers have lengthy marketing backgrounds and formal marketing and writing education. Get in touch today and we’ll get you taken care of - no scalpels needed.
