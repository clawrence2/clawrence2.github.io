        <h4>Backstory</h4>
        <p>Before launching Oshin, I did a lot of research on current market offerings for websites and talked with
            dozens of people about their sites, how much they paid and what their experiences with their design firm had
            been. </p>
        <p>Honestly, I was shocked at how many people were overpaying and not being taken care of properly. Before you
            invest in a new website, please take a minute to read this guide to ensure you’re getting what you pay for.
        </p>
        <h4>Do they understand your business?</h4>
        <p>Before getting into any of the technical offerings, the first and most important step when shopping for a web
            developer/designer is to ensure that they understand your business and the goals for your website. Having a
            slick looking website is great, but it needs to be tailored to your target audience. </p>
        <p>Your designer/developer is your storyteller. They need to understand your business and its unique value
            proposition in order to convey a compelling story. Otherwise you’ll end up with a website that may look
            professional but is completely ineffective at completing its intended goal.</p>
        <p>Ask designers about their process - do they spend a lot of time with you getting to know your business and
            your goals? Do they change their approach based upon your objectives? </p>
        <p class="bold">Takeaway: Ensure that your designer is going to take the time to understand your needs and make
            a website that matches them.</p>

        <h4>Do they write the content?</h4>
        <p>If you’re going with a big agency, chances are the person writing the copy for your website will be dedicated solely to writing marketing copy and typically will have a lot of experience in that area. Make sure to ask who is writing the content. </p>
        <p>In most other cases, you’ll be expected to write the content yourself, or hire another third party to do it. If your designer is writing the copy themselves, see if they have a background in writing marketing copy and have experience in that area.
        </p>
        <p class="bold">Takeaway: The point here is this - if you’re paying tens of thousands of dollars to an agency,
            they should be
            providing you with effective marketing copy that is targeted to your specific needs.
        </p>
        <h4>Do they actually do custom designs?</h4>
        <p>It’s (unfortunately) common practice to use a premade template and customize it slightly to fit your content.
            This is a far cry from having a fully custom web design that is then expertly coded. The best practice is to
            design your website with mockup software such as <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> and then send you a link to the mockup. You
            typically then review the design and suggest any edits you want and then it goes to coding.
        </p>
        <p>Be sure to ask them if they provide mockups on the front end. If they show you a fully-made website as the
            mockup, then chances are they just used a template. </p>
        <p class="bold">Takeaway: If you’re paying top dollar for your website you should be getting a fully custom
            design. </p>
        <h4>Do they write their own code?</h4>
        <p>Beautiful design is only half the battle. Once the design is done, it needs to be coded (usually with three
            languages: CSS, HTML and JavaScript). There are some designers that use website builders to make their
            designs. </p>
        <p>A website builder is software that builds a website graphically (the user drags and drops elements onto the
            page, rather than coding them using a programming language), the software then writes the code
            automatically. While this may seem like a great solution it can actually be very limiting. </p>
        <p>A hand-coded website has limitless possibilities whereas a website created with a website builder does have
            built-in limitations. On top of that, if you want a developer to make changes to your site in the future you
            may have issues since (depending on the website builder software used) the code may or not be directly
            editable. </p>
        <p class="bold">Takeaway: If you’re paying top dollar for a website, but someone is just dragging and dropping
            things together, you may be overpaying compared to someone painstakingly coding every single element of your
            website.
        </p>
        <h4>What’s their philosophy on mobile/responsive design?</h4>
        <p>It’s estimated that <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/ui-design/what-is-mobile-first-design/">72.5%
                of web traffic will come from mobile devices in 2025.</a> </p>
        <p>Because of this, many design firms are switching to mobile-first layouts. What this means is that your site
            will be designed to look great on a device with a small screen (e.g. a smartphone or a tablet). This is the
            opposite of starting out with a gorgeous desktop site and then scaling down to a mobile phone. </p>
        <p>There are pros and cons of both desktop first and mobile first design, but your developer should at least be
            aware of the situation and able to make your site look amazing on mobile.</p>
        <p class="bold">Takeaway: Your designer should know about mobile first and be expecting to give you two designs
            - one for desktop and one for mobile. They should also understand the principles of effective mobile design.
        </p>
        <h4>What's their take on stock images?</h4>
        <p>It’s important to ask your prospective designer/developer about stock images - what’s their take on it?
        </p>
        <p>When someone says stock images I immediately think back to my health sciences textbook from middle school
            where every kid had outdated clothes because the textbook had been in use twenty years before my time. </p>
        <p>Stock images can be an asset and a hindrance. Imagine you’re a law firm or a financial services business and
            on the front page of your website is a cheesy picture of a stock photo actor shaking hands with a
            prospective client. It’s going to look fake from a mile away and it’s going to make your business look
            unprofessional. </p>
        <p>There are other cases where stock photos can be a huge asset. If you need a beautiful background for part of
            your site, or need a social graphic, you can use stock photos, add some text and you’re off to the races.
        </p>
        <p class="bold">
            Takeaway: The point is, your new designer/developer should know how and when to properly employ stock photos.
        </p>
        <h4>How many revisions do you get?</h4>
        <p>Once the first iteration of your design is done, you usually get two to three revisions. That means that once
            the design is done, you can ask the designer to make changes and then they send the design back to you. </p>
        <p>More is not always better. </p>
        <p>Let’s say your designer gives you unlimited changes. Great right? Not exactly. Unlimited revisions could mean
            that your designer isn’t in a hurry to do your design and will just delay the project indefinitely until you
            stop asking for changes, it can also mean that they like to take their time. </p>
        <p>
            If you have a contract that limits the design changes to 3 this can be a benefit for both of you. It means
            that you’re not going to have to go back and forth for months to get the design right and it means the
            designer has to do a great job the first time. Additionally, if you hire a competent designer, then three
            should be more than enough.
        </p>
        <p class="bold">Takeaway: Unlimited revisions can be a red flag.
        </p>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>There is a tremendous amount of work that goes into crafting an effective website. Be sure to shop around and
            ask the right questions before trusting something as important as your website to someone. </p>
