        <h2>Why you shouldn't build your own website</h2>

        <img srcset="images/medical-tools-revamp.jpg 1200w, images/medical-tools-mobile-450.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 450px,

        <h4>Today’s the day!</h4>
        <p> After weeks of waiting, it’s finally here! Your do-it-yourself heart surgery kit has just come in the mail!
            You’ve got your home office decked out with towels and mirrors and you’re ready to get rid of that nagging
            pain in your chest!
        </p>

        <p>
            Obviously this never happens. Why? Well for one, most of us are not heart surgeons, and for those of us who
            are - we aren’t about to perform open heart surgery on ourselves. If the website is the heart of our
            business -
            or at least the source of our credibility online, why do so
            many of us think we can operate on it on our own?
        </p>
        <p>
            We’ve all had the thought - if I use this platform or that platform (not naming names) there are tons of
            beautiful custom templates I can use! And on top of it, there’s a plugin for SEO! And it’s CHEAP! No brainer
            right?
        </p>

        <p> Wrong.</p>




        <p>Custom templates can sound great - but almost always they will end up looking homemade or unprofessional. It
            is estimated that <a href="https://www.sweor.com/firstimpressions" target="_blank">75% of users base their
                impression of the credibility of your business on the design
                of your website</a>. This means you could have the world’s most amazing business, be an upstanding,
            trustworthy, service-oriented firm that everyone loves, but if you used a DIY website builder, chances are
            you’re going to lose credibility with folks that don’t know you.</p>

        <p>But wait there’s more!</p>

        <p>Everyone has a website these days - even your elderly neighbor lady’s book club probably has a website. We
            support that (and if you need a website for your book club let us know) but that also means that your
            competitors have websites too. As mentioned above, if users are making a judgment call on your business, purely
            on how good your design looks, then it seems like it’d be pretty darn important to invest in something that
            looks great - especially better than your competitors.</p>

        <h4>Know What You’re Paying For</h4>
        <p>Ok cool, I’ll go find a pro to build my website. Unfortunately, it’s not that simple. Different web design
            firms use different methods. Some web design firms have really fancy custom templates that they’ve made and
            will throw your content into - this means that the end result can look similar to their other clients - it
            also means they’re spending less time coding your project. In other words, you’re paying a premium price for
            a cookie-cutter product. </p>

        <p>Did you know that some web design firms don’t even write their own code? They’ll use fancy website builders
            (that granted, do have a learning curve) but they are limited in what they’re able to build. </p>

        <p>Ok you say, you found someone who does all of their designs from scratch and hand codes everything. Awesome!
            Sounds like you’re on the right track. However, do they know how to write? I’m sure they can code and design
            just fine, but do they have formal training in writing marketing copy? Too often, web design firms will
            expect you to be the marketing guru and know how to write impactful, moving, energetic marketing content
            that will drive conversions. </p>

        <h4>The Oshin Way</h4>
        <p>At Oshin our main goal is to craft you an impressive, captivating site that draws users in with its design
            and blows them away with its content. We don’t cut corners and put the time in to ensure everything is done

            away and build trust with your customers. Not only that, our content writers have lengthy marketing
            backgrounds and formal marketing and writing education. Get in touch today and we’ll get you taken care of -
            no scalpels needed.</p>
